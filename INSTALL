## Building

The build system for the micro-benchmarks consists of a Makefile and platform-specific
.inc files that are located in the platform_inc directory. The .inc file specifies
compiler and linker flags as well as preprocessor macros. The directory includes a 
generic .inc file for a standard Linux platform and GCC for reference. You can create
a new .inc file for your system - the naming convention is ${ARCH}_${CC}_${OPT}.inc, 
where:

- ARCH denotes the system, e.g. generic, linux, mac, cray
- CC is the compiler
- OPT specifies whether an optimised or debug version should be built

In order to build using the default platform file, simply do

%> make

which is in fact short for

%> make ARCH=generic CC=gcc OPT=opt

Change the values of ARCH, CC or OPT to pick up different .inc files for your build
process.


## Executing

If the build process was successful, you should have an executable called "micro". 

Executing

%> ./kernel -h

will display all the different benchmark options availble.

%> ./kernel -i

will (on a Linux platform) give information on the system architecture and the data 
type sizes, which is useful when interpreting the results of the benchmarks.
